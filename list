 replace anything that's not an a-z letter with a space as a preprocessing step using gsub:
 Newcol <- gsub("[^a-zA-Z]+", " ", Newcol)
gsub("(?!')[[:punct:]]", "", str2, perl=TRUE)
# [1] "this doesn't not have an apostrophe"
gsub("[^'[:lower:] ]", "", str2) 
# [1] "this doesn't not have an apostrophe"
